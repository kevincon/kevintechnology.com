For my Haskell final project, I contributed to [Chris Done’s](https://chrisdone.com) Haskell library for the Kinect ([https://github.com/chrisdone/freenect](https://github.com/chrisdone/freenect)) that wraps the functionality of the open-source `libfreenect` library. My contribution was adding support for the RGB video camera (previously only support for the depth camera existed).

Here’s a link to my GitHub repo with video support added in: [https://github.com/kevincon/freenect](https://github.com/kevincon/freenect)

And if you’re interested in reading the report write-up, I’ve uploaded it to my website [here]({{ "/assets/cis194.pdf" | absolute_url }}).

Here’s a picture I took with the Kinect once my project was completed:
