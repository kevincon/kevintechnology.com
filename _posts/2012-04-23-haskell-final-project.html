<p>For my Haskell final project, I contributed to <a href="http://chrisdone.com" target="_blank">Chris Done&rsquo;s</a> Haskell library for the Kinect (<a href="https://github.com/chrisdone/freenect" target="_blank">https://github.com/chrisdone/freenect</a>) that wraps the functionality of the open-source libfreenect library. My contribution was adding support for the video camera (previously only support for the depth camera was built-in).</p>
<p>Here&rsquo;s a link to my github repo with video support added in:Â <a href="https://github.com/kevincon/freenect" target="_blank">https://github.com/kevincon/freenect</a></p>
<p>And if you&rsquo;re interested in reading the report write-up, I&rsquo;ve uploaded it to my website here: <a href="http://static.kevintechnology.com/docs/cis194.pdf" target="_blank">http://static.kevintechnology.com/docs/cis194.pdf</a></p>
<p>Here&rsquo;s a picture I took with the Kinect once my project was completed:</p>
