<p class="MsoNormal">We woke up early and went to the hotel’s restaurant, called Naru, to eat breakfast.<span>  </span>It was a buffet and I was glad to see some eggs, bacon, and sausage after the fried chicken events of the night before.<span>  </span>After breakfast we got all of our AutoPlug supplies together and went to the lobby to wait for our shuttle.<span>  </span>There we noticed a few other International teams.<span>  </span>We introduced ourselves to a group of students from Germany and Finland.<span>  </span>Their project was a radio-controlled hovercraft!<span>  </span>So cool!<span>  </span>It looked inexpensive to make too: just Styrofoam, duct tape, CPU fans, and microcontrollers.<span>  </span>We also spoke with a woman from Australia, Jenny, who happened to be representing the Serval project I had read about online at <a href="http://www.servalproject.org/" target="_blank">www.servalproject.org</a>.<span>  </span>Their project is very cool, it is a peer-to-peer network for cell phones that replaces the need for cell towers.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><em>Walking to the yellow shuttle bus to take us to the competition venue</em></p>
<p class="MsoNormal">We met a Korean girl from the competition named Kristen and she led us to the shuttle bus.<span>  </span>The shuttle drove us about 15 minutes to Digital Media City and The Business Tower where the competition was going to be held.<span>  </span>We went up to a conference room where we met all of the other teams and had our orientation.<span> </span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><em>Orientation, meeting the other teams, general info session</em></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><em><img src="https://78.media.tumblr.com/tumblr_lce6riNnn91qcrluu.jpg"/></em></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><em>Woo!</em></p>
<p class="MsoNormal">There are 8 international teams total, from 12 countries.<span>  </span>We are the only American team in the competition.<span>  </span>They gave us a lanyard/ID tag to wear and also our food tickets for the competition lunches.<span>  </span>We also met our interpreter, Kai.<span>  </span>She’s a very sweet girl who will help us present AutoPlug to the non-English-speaking judges and also provide general advice/guidance.<span>  </span>The breakdown of the eight teams and their projects are:</p>
<p class="MsoListParagraphCxSpFirst"><!--[if !supportLists]--><span><span>1.<span>       </span></span></span><!--[endif]-->AutoPlug – Univ. of Penn (you know us)</p>

<p class="MsoListParagraphCxSpLast"><em>AHHH! Too much legitimacy!</em></p>
<p class="MsoNormal">The rest of the day was spent preparing for the official competition the next day.<span>  </span>We had brought a bunch of duplicates of the components that go into making the blue-box gateway for AutoPlug, and we mounted them on a poster board and labeled the components very neatly.<span>  </span>We also finalized our powerpoint presentations and demonstration.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><em><img src="https://78.media.tumblr.com/tumblr_lce79p2VjG1qcrluu.jpg"/></em></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><em>This is what the competition venue looks like with all the booths.</em></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><em>Outside of the venue at night.</em></p>
<p class="MsoNormal">We broke for lunch around noon and Kai led us to the Food Court.<span>  </span>The Food Court was a very interesting experience.<span>  </span>Unlike American mall food courts, you order whatever you want from a counter that is outside the court, and then you receive a number which represents your order.<span>  </span>When your order is shown on an LCD monitor, you go to that specific restaurant in the Food Court and pick up your order.<span>  </span>Kai recommended a beef soup dish so we got that and it was pretty good.<span>  </span>Over lunch we learned that Kai is doing post-grad work studying to become a professional interpreter (so this job was perfect for her!).<span>  </span>She did her undergrad in computer science so she had enough of a technical background to understand what our project was about.<span>  </span>Once we got our food I asked Kai where we could get something to drink.<span>  </span>She started looking for a nearby convenience store.<span>  </span>This confused me, but Kai explained that usually Koreans don’t drink anything with their food (that’s what the rice is for, she said).<span>  </span>I thought this was interesting, but afterwards we saw a place in the Food Court where you can fill a small silver cup with water to drink.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><img src="https://78.media.tumblr.com/tumblr_lce6tyPDoV1qcrluu.jpg"/></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><em>Soooo many people at the Food Court!</em></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><em><img src="https://78.media.tumblr.com/tumblr_lce6urY7TN1qcrluu.jpg"/></em></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><em>You can see the different restaurants of the Food Court in the background.</em></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><em><img src="https://78.media.tumblr.com/tumblr_lce6w4FlD21qcrluu.jpg"/></em></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><em>This is what I had for lunch.  Does anyone know what it is called?</em></p>
<p class="MsoNormal">After preparing for the competition all day we took the shuttle back to the hotel.<span>  </span>Kai told us that our hotel was in an area in Seoul famous for its Korean BBQ restaurants.<span>  </span>She recommended a restaurant called Chae Dae Po and said it was nearby.<span>  </span>So when we got back to the hotel we put our stuff down and looked up directions to Chae Dae Po.<span>  </span>Unfortunately it was all in Korean, but we got the general area down.<span>  </span>It was about a block away from the hotel and we were able to ask someone on the street to point us the rest of the way.<span>  </span>Chae Dae Po was a very interesting experience.<span>  </span>Pretty much no one in the restaurant spoke English.<span>  </span>We were led to a table with a grill built into the top and we sat down on red stools.<span>  </span>A waiter came by and had zero luck communicating with us.<span>  </span>He went away and brought back a girl who spoke a very tiny amount of English.<span>  </span>She wrote on paper what we could order:<span>  </span>either pork or beef with two options for each.<span>  </span>We ordered one sweet pork and one salty pork.<span>  </span>She brought out a bunch of bowls with vegetables and sauces and then brought out the meat.<span>  </span>She cooked the meat right in front of us on the grill and let us know when it was done.<span>  </span>We managed to communicate with her enough to find out that she was 18 and a sophomore in high school.<span>  </span>She said that’s where she was learning English.<span>  </span>When we were finished we went to the front to pay.<span>  </span>The guy who was going to clean our table off bowed to me and I sort of awkwardly bowed back.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">We pretty much immediately went to sleep back at the hotel, because we had to wake up early for the competition!</p>
