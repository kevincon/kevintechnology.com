<p class="MsoNormal">We didn’t have time to eat breakfast before we left for the competition venue on the shuttle bus.<span>  </span>When we got to the Business Tower we went to go check on our booth.<span>  </span>We decided to reorganize things a little by pushing our two tables back towards the back of the booth.<span>  </span>Kai complimented us on the organization of our booth; she said it was much neater than the other teams.<span>  </span>Kristen came by to wish us luck, but we think she got the translation wrong because she kept telling us to “cheer up!”</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><em>Me, Kai, and Madhur ready for the competition!</em></p>
<p class="MsoNormal">We were having some difficulties with our demonstration.<span>  </span>The set up involves the blue-box gateway being connected to a monitor.<span>  </span>When you open the myMechanic app on the iPad, the gateway starts playing a video of a car driving around Philadelphia on the monitor that is synchronized with the data being sent to the iPad.<span>  </span>However, the monitor kept going to sleep on us, because of the power settings of the gateway.<span>  </span>We weren’t sure how to change the power settings since the Ubuntu running on the gateway is command-line-only (no GUI software is installed), so it looked really bad when the monitor just cut out during our demonstration.<span>  </span>I asked Kai for a USB keyboard and she made some calls to try to get us one.<span>  </span>In the mean time, we tried to run our demo as soon as the judges approached so that it would not cut out while they were there.<span> </span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><em>Awesome gateway schematic poster we made the day before the competition</em></p>
<p class="MsoNormal">At some point in the morning the first group of judges came by.<span>  </span>They actually spoke English so Kai just stood there in case they didn’t completely understand something.<span>  </span>We gave them our presentation and they didn’t seem to react much at all.<span>  </span>At the end one of the judges asked us to show him a demo of a plug-n-play device working with AutoPlug.<span>  </span>We had to tell him that we haven’t implemented one yet.<span>  </span>So we didn’t think we did a very good job with the first group of judges, but I talked to Jenny from the Serval team and she said it was about the same for them.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">At 11 AM there was an opening ceremony for the competition, but it was entirely in Korean.<span>  </span>I guess they didn’t think the International teams would want to hear the ceremony.<span>  </span>We got Kai to translate a few things for us, though.<span>  </span>One of the big things was that there were several VIPs, like executives of big engineering companies and representatives from the Korean government.<span>   </span>At the end of the ceremony the VIPs made their way directly to us!<span>  </span>There was a man with a microphone and a cameraman.<span>  </span>Kai explained that they wanted us to give them our presentation right then for the VIPs to see!<span>  </span>But we weren’t able to start the demo correctly since we were rushed, so we basically gave them the presentation and sheepishly told them the demo wasn’t working right now.<span>  </span>Then the microphone man said we were out of time and they moved on to a domestic booth.<span>  </span>Yikes, well that didn’t go very well, but luckily there weren’t any judges in the group so maybe it doesn’t matter.<span>  </span>We thought it was interesting that they didn’t seem to interview any of the other international teams, though…</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><em>Opening ceremony.  I wish they had translated all of it into English for us.</em></p>
<p class="MsoNormal">At noon we broke for lunch and went to the Food Court again.<span>  </span>This time we asked Kai to order for us some bibimbop.<span>  </span>It was difficult to find a seat since so many people from the competition were eating there as well.<span>  </span>The bibimbop was pretty good.<span>  </span>We asked Kai about the North Korean attack the day before.<span>  </span>She said that stuff like that happens a lot, but this time she was more nervous because they attacked civilians.<span>  </span>She thought it was good that we were leaving in a few days in case anything else happened.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">After lunch we finally received the USB keyboard.<span>  </span>This allowed us to login to the gateway directly instead of remote connecting in using one of our laptops.<span>  </span>The ability to login directly would allow us to press a key on the keyboard if the monitor went to sleep.<span>  </span>Our second group of judges came by for a presentation, and this time it was much better.<span>  </span>The presentation was great, the demo was great, and all the judges took the AutoPlug SDK discs we had made (thanks Susan and Anish!).<span>  </span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal">After that group of judges we took some time to walk around and look at the domestic teams’ projects.<span>  </span>There were some very cool things.<span>  </span>One group had a kayak gaming experience with a kayak you sit in and a paddle controller.<span>  </span>The kayak actually moved around and there was a fan that blew air on you and you could see where you were going on a projector screen in front of you.<span>  </span>There were two teams with table-top touch screen interactive computers.<span>  </span>One was meant for phone companies to show off their phones, so you would put a particular phone on the table and the table would recognize it and show information, pictures, and video about it.<span>  </span>Then if you put multiple phones on the table you can compare and contrast different models, very cool!<span>  </span>There were also tons of robots, at least 5 quadrotor helicopters, and a ball segway.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><em>Put several phones on the table and compare/contrast their features!</em></p>
<p class="MsoNormal">There was one more group of judges near the end of the competition, but we had already packed up our demo materials so we just gave them the presentation.<span>  </span>I think we did pretty good overall in the competition, but it really depends on what the judges were looking for.<span>  </span>If they were looking for a really cool toy or physical demo, then we probably didn’t win anything.<span>  </span>But if they were looking for a groundbreaking open source concept, then maybe we will end up winning something.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><em>Me and Madhur with the AutoPlug gateway</em></p>
<p class="MsoNormal">Madhur and I got to be pretty good friends with a guy named Dany who worked on the Serval project (France).<span>  </span>During the down-time of the competition, Dany and I flirted with our interpreters and tried to get them to go out with us after the competition.<span>  </span>Sadly, we were unsuccessful.<span>  </span>But Dany, Madhur, and I went out after the competition to a chicken restaurant called Tacoya Chicken.<span>  </span>The legal drinking age in Korea is 19, so I had my first legal drink ever in the form of Cass beer at the restaurant.<span>  </span>It was actually probably the best beer I’ve ever tasted.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">After the competition all the teams broke down their booths and said goodbye to the competition organizers.<span>  </span>We said goodbye to Kai and Kristen.<span>  </span>Kristen said she had been looking at pictures of Penn’s campus on the Internet and that she wants to come visit sometime.<span>  </span>I told her to doooo it. :)</p>
