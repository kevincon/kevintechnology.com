<p>If you download Scala from the <a href="http://www.scala-lang.org/downloads" target="_blank">official site</a>, it comes as a tgz archive of folders containing binaries. In other words, it&rsquo;s a stand-alone install that you can put wherever you want. If you&rsquo;re like me and would prefer Scala tucked away in the operating system, you&rsquo;ll want to start by installing the awesome OS X package manager, <a href="http://mxcl.github.com/homebrew/" target="_blank">Homebrew</a>.</p><p>First, make sure you have Xcode installed (it&rsquo;s free in the Mac App Store) with its optional command line tools installed (in Xcode go to Preferences, Downloads, and click &ldquo;Install&rdquo; next to Command Line Tools).</p>
<p>Next, install Homebrew by running the following in a terminal: </p>
<blockquote>
<p>ruby -e &ldquo;$(curl -fsSL <a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/master/install" target="_blank">https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/master/install</a>)&rdquo;

<br/></p>
</blockquote>
<p><i>Note: The above command is changed by the Homebrew guys from time to time. If the above command doesn&rsquo;t seem to be working, check the Homebrew website for the latest incantation: <a href="http://brew.sh/" target="_blank">http://brew.sh/</a></i></p>
<p>Follow the instructions and enter your system password when prompted. Once Homebrew is installed, it&rsquo;s super easy to install Scala by typing the following in a terminal:</p>
<blockquote>

<p>brew install scala</p>

</blockquote>
<p>Homebrew will install Scala in /usr/local, which is important for a <a href="http://hivelogic.com/articles/using_usr_local/" target="_blank">number of reasons</a>, and it also puts the man pages for the Scala tools in the appropriate place.</p>
<p>If your next step is to learn Scala, I&rsquo;m finding &ldquo;Programming in Scala&rdquo; to be very helpful. It was written by the creator of Scala, Martin Odersky, and the first edition is free online at <a href="http://www.artima.com/pins1ed/" target="_blank">http://www.artima.com/pins1ed/</a>.</p>
