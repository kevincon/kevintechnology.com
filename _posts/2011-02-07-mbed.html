<p>I got my mbed today!  I haven&rsquo;t played with it yet, but I hope to use it to make some cool stuff soon.</p>

<p>I really like how it comes with a plastic wallet insert pinout diagram.  They really expect you to carry the mbed around with you in your pocket and just whip it out whenever you need to build something.  </p>
<p>Hehe, I should implement some of the ESE 350 labs on the mbed.  Then, when someone complains to me about how their HC12 isn&rsquo;t working, I can be all like, &ldquo;HAHAHA DON&rsquo;T YOU WISH YOU HAD ONE OF THEEEEEEESE?&rdquo; And then that&rsquo;s when I take it out, plug it into the USB port, hit the go button, and BAM:  instant DTMF generator.</p>
<p>I have a few projects in mind for my mbed, but I&rsquo;m also open to suggestions. :)</p>
