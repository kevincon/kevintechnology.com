<p>This past week I got to play with the cross-platform Asio and Boost.Asio C++ libraries for socket programming.</p>
<p>Unfortunately it turns out what I was trying to do (inject network packets) is not possible with these libraries, but in the process of trying to get that to work I was able to use the basic_raw_socket template class successfully, which it looks like <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/8022452/boost-asio-raw-sockets" target="_blank">several</a>Â <a href="http://d.hatena.ne.jp/devm33/20120208/1328718970" target="_blank">other people</a> on the Internet are having trouble with. So I&rsquo;ve written up a github repository with the code and a pretty detailed README. I hope it will help others understand how to use raw sockets in Asio better.</p>
