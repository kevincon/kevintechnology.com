A little about me:

I've been lucky to have worked on the following projects:

💳 managed dev environments and tooling for
[Square Point of Sale devices](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Square_(financial_services)#Devices) \
🤖 HIL test automation for
[Intel Optane solid state drive](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/3D_XPoint) firmware \
👓 graphics firmware for the
[Intel Vaunt smart glasses](https://www.theverge.com/2018/4/18/17255354/intel-vaunt-shut-down) \
⌚️ app/UI firmware for [Pebble smart watches](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pebble_(watch))

I also enjoy drinking cold brew, solving puzzles, playing video games, and birdwatching.
